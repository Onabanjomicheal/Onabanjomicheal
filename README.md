<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Onabanjo Michael— a recent Electrical and Electronics Engineering graduate</h1>
<h1>Just imagine an equitable and fair transportation system where commuters live their lives free of fear of accidents, endless delays, or harmful pollution. 🌍✨ That's the future we're striving to build! 😊</h1>

My vision for transportation policy is rooted in the pursuit of efficiency, sustainability, and safety. I am committed to: 
- **Reducing traffic congestion**—not merely for convenience, but to unlock significant economic productivity, lower emissions, and enhance quality of life.
- **Accelerating the transition to electric vehicles**, recognizing that this shift is not only vital for reducing emissions but also for fostering public health, advancing energy independence, and strengthening environmental resilience.
- **Promoting responsible traffic behavior**, ensuring that roadways are governed by respect, compliance, and shared accountability, thereby improving overall efficiency and safety.
- **Advancing autonomous vehicle technologies**, with the aim of dramatically improving transportation safety, reducing human error, and setting new standards for mobility innovation.

Together, these commitments form the foundation of a forward-looking transportation system that serves both current and future generations.
