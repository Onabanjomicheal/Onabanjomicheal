<h1>Imagine an equitable and fair transportation system where commuters live their lives free of fear of accidents, endless delays, or harmful pollution. 🌍✨ That's the future we're striving to build! 😊</h1>

Michael is a recent Electrical and Electronics Engineering graduate, my journey is fueled by a profound passion for sustainable mobility, intelligent systems, and climate-resilient infrastructure. I believe the true power of engineering lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and sustainable development, where technology isn't just a tool, but a catalyst for real, tangible impact.

I'm particularly committed to applying these technological advancements:

- **Reduce traffic congestion**, not just for convenience, but for the economic and environmental benefits it brings.
- Accelerating the transition to **electric vehicles** isn't just about **reducing emissions**; it's about building healthier communities and fostering energy independence.
- And crucially, I'm dedicated to improving transportation safety through **autonomous vehicles**.

My commitment in transportation is about ensuring that progress is equitable and that everyone benefits from a safer, more efficient, and sustainable transportation future —especially in developing regions.

Lets collaborate on:
- **Intelligent Traffic Management**
- **Electric Vehicle Infrastructure & Adoption**
- **Battery Management Systems (BMS)**
- **Autonomous Transport Safety**
